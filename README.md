Leaflets lets you discover and publish content based on categories. Explore your interests by following passionate people. Write purposeful content on meaningful topics you love, and let us circulate it around the globe.

Leaflets is about publishing purposeful and meaningful content. Think of Leaflets like a Global Advertisement board. Now, you will not write about your shenanigans in your local newspaper, billboard, or distribute leaflets about it etc right? Well maybe you do. Either way, Leaflets is not the place for it. So be thoughtful about what you publish, as it is public by default, and may be viewed all around the World instantly.

So stop reading this, [get the app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/leaflets/id1071747506?mt=8), and start publishing. Enjoy!
